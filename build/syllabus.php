				<p>
					<a href="http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html" target="_blank">Attendance is mandatory</a>. Students are expected to attend all classes and strictly adhere to the project due dates. Lack of participation in class discussions will count against your grade.

				<p>
					Note that an excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student&rsquo;s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or some other serious and important personal circumstance. An absence will be excused only if there is documentation verifying the circumstances that caused the absence.
